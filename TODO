- Factor out functionality from 4_1.pl (create a separate 4_2.pl?)
- Maybe use classes for object file format, if desired
- Refactor 4_1.pl and rewrite tests in Perl
- rename 4_1.pl to something that reflects it's for all ch4 projs?

basic cycle:
- run test
- diff out file against expected
- pass/fail
